	<p class="info">I use many technologies my favorites include:</p>
	<br /><br />
	<section>
		<p class="title">Docker</p>
		<p>
			Docker is a tool I use everyday, from creating reproducable development
			enviornments, to wrapping services for deployment. I am able to write
			minimal base images optimized for space.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p class="title">Rust</p>
		<p>
			The server this site runs on is <a href="https://rocket.rs" target="_blank">rocket.rs</a> which means the
			backend routing logic for the site is written 100% in Rust!
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p class="title">Go</p>
		<p>
			I write Go code sometimes to not nearly as much as with other languages
			but I find some of it's libraries really usefull. I also know how to write
			goroutines which is fun!
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p class="title">Linux/Unix</p>
		<p>
			I've always loved UNIX, and the command line, specifically I love building
			advanced command line shells. I know how to use both canonical(cooked)
			mode, and noncanonical(raw). Also advanced command line argument parsers.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p class="title">Bash</p>
		<p>
			Bash is one of my favoraite tools. I am adept with Bash scripting/misc
			bash stuffs including how to write Manpages command substitution, piping
			etc. I mainly use it for composing applications together and I use it for
			Docker helper scripts
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p class="title">Python</p>
		<p>
			Python was my first programming language, I usually use this for rapid
			prototyping, automation, and glue code. Some popular libraries that I use
			are Python Prompt Toolkit and Flask
